ADHD Study Timer

This is a streamlit app that helps with a study technique that I've been working with this semester
- 20 minutes studying one thing
- 20 minutes studying another thing
- 20 minutes of break
- Rinse, and Repeat

This works with homework, cleaning, coding, and basically any other chore or task I have to do.
I was just using the timer app on my phone, but having the list next to it helps remind me what I need to be doing
And remind me to do less important chores or tasks that I usually forget about

Streamlit, while fun to learn, is not the best for this app. It doesn't deal with concurrent tasks well at all.
I'm in the process of converting the code into Django, which is much better for the task.
